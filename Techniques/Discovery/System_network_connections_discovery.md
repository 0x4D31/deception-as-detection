# System Network Connections Discovery

MITRE ATT&CK technique [T1049](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1049)

Tactic: Discovery

Platform: Windows, Linux, Mac

### Deception Techniques
* Open network connections to fake systems or network services (i.e. honeypots)

### Useful Tools
* [Beeswarm](https://github.com/honeynet/beeswarm) - It intentionally leaks credentials in the network traffic and then looks for the unexpected reuse of these honey credentials. Beeswarm operates by deploying fake end-user systems (clients) and services (honeypots).
