# File and Directory Discovery

MITRE ATT&CK technique [T1083](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1083)
Tactic: Discovery
Platform: Windows, Linux, Mac

### Deception Techniques
* Create fake directories and files (i.e. honeyfiles) and monitor the access to them using go-audit, auditd or a File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).
* Create beacon files that phone home when opened.
* Create files containing deceptive content and breadcrumbs to lure the attacker toward your honeypots.

### Useful Tools
* [honeybits](https://github.com/0x4D31/honeybits) - A tool designed to enhance the effectiveness of honeypots by spreading breadcrumbs & honeytokens across the system. Currently supports creating honeyfiles and several breadcrumbs including fake bash_history entries.
* [go-audit](https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit) - An alternative to the auditd daemon, with json output.
* [honeyÎ»](https://github.com/0x4D31/honeyLambda) - Serverless application designed to create and monitor URL honeytokens (i.e. fake HTTP endpoints) automatically
