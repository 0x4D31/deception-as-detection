# Exploitation of Vulnerability

MITRE ATT&CK technique [T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1068)
Tactic: Credential Access, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, Privilege Escalation
Platform: Windows, Linux, Mac 

### Deception Techniques
* Set up fake resources using low-interation or high-interaction honeypots
    * Emulated or real operating systems, network protocols/services, or vulnerabilities

### Useful Tools
* [Dionaea](https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea) - A low-interaction honeypot to trap malware exploiting vulnerabilities exposed
by services offerd to a network. Dionaea emulates several protocols such as smb, sip, ftp, tftp, mssql, mysql, http, and uses libemu to detect shellcodes.
* [Glutton](https://github.com/mushorg/glutton) - All eating honeypot
* [Amun](https://github.com/zeroq/amun) - A low-interaction honeypot, following the concepts of Nepenthes but extending it with more sophisticated emulation and easier maintenance.
* [Conpot](https://github.com/mushorg/conpot) - ICS/SCADA honeypot
* Snare & Tanner - Successors to [Glastopf](https://github.com/mushorg/glastopf) web application honeypot.
    * [SNARE](https://github.com/mushorg/snare) - Super Next generation Advanced Reactive honEypot
    * [Tanner](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner) - Evaluating SNARE events
* [Sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig)
* [MazeRunner](https://community.cymmetria.com/) community edition
